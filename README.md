# Autonomous-Green-House-System
 IOT application for Autonomous Green House System
## Problem Statement:
Most greenhouse systems still use the manual system to monitor the temperature and humidity in the greenhouse. But as the size of greenhouse system increases it would be difficult to monitor the entire system manually. Many automated systems are being developed in modern world for automating the monitoring of greenhouse system. However, more measurement data is also needed to make this kind of automation system work properly. Increased number of measurement points should not dramatically increase the automation system cost. 
If the greenhouse system is far away, the problem would be a person visiting the greens house system frequent. Then the reading of the temperature and humidity must be checked manually to make sure the greenhouse is in normal condition. This project therefore is mainly designed to monitor the greenhouse remotely. Monitoring the temperature and humidity in greenhouse through a mobile application can reduce time and make problem easy. The second problem is many greenhouse systems still use the cable to send data from sensor level to monitoring. It is difficult to install the system if the greenhouse is far away from maintenance office. The data cables can easily damage if laid in high temperature and danger condition. This project uses wireless sensor network to send data from greenhouse to the monitoring base station.

## Objective of Project 
The purpose of greenhouse monitoring system using wireless sensor network prototype is to collect the transmitting and receiving data within the greenhouse infrastructure. This data can be used to take appropriate measures on the green house system. The main objective of this project is to monitor the temperature and humidity of the green house system using wireless sensor network with a ZigBee protocol running on the wireless devices.
